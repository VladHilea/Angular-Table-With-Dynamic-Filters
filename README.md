Demo version can be found [HERE](https://www.vlad-hilea.com/angular-tabel/) !
 
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.1.2.

It wil automatically run with a default configuration, for the table, but you can update it from the UI.
The applcation contains filters for A,B,C columns which are dynamically updated based on the remaining possible options from the table/
The user also has the option to clear a filter completely.

An extra feature added is that if a column only has one possible option, it will automatically be chosen (auto-set). But if another filter is removed, which will offer more possible filtering options for the auto-set one, it will be removed and the user will have all the available options.
